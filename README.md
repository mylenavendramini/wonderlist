# Wonderlist

Welcome to Wonderlist, a website designed to organize and visualize a trip itinerary.

## Features

![alt text](/client/public/main-page.png)

You can create a collection of trips, add cities and dates, and the app generates a timeline for you. You can plan activities for each day and mark the ones you've already done. You can also use a map to find the places you want to add for each city on your trip. These places will be organized by categories that you can also create. Wonderlist also tells you how many days are left until the day of your trip.

## Usage

Once you have the Wonderlist running, you can start organizing your trips using the following steps:

- Register or Login
- Create a trip collection
- Choose cities and dates for the trip
- Check your trip collections
- Create and delete activities, mark activities as done
